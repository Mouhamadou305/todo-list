# TodoList

This project was a tutorial to understand how to use angular. It is a todo list. You can :
* Add a task by filling the text input with the description of your task and clicking on the add button.
* Delete a task by clicking on the cross button on the right of a task.
* Check or uncheck a task by clicking on it.

## JSON-server

Install json server with npm and run it in the root folder of the todo-list application. On the environment.ts file, the endpoint of the json-server is specified. You can change it if needed.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
